This program uses RSA encryption to encrypt and decrypt a file specified in the command line. After compiling the Java files, run RSAKeyGen.java to generate the RSA keys. To sign a file, run "RSASign s file_name". This generates a file with the .sig extension. To verify the encryption, run "RSASign v file_name.sig".
